This is the repo for our project for CS4278. We will create a clustering algorithm desktop application to help 
Dr. Padovani-Claudio visualize patient data and common patterns.
This includes a file upload system, with instructions for specifying the necessary format of the file, 
that will run the t-SNE algorithm with default settings once the file is validated. 
The interactive plot display screen allows for the user to adjust weights to specific attributes to see 
how it affects the clustering/associations between the data, as well as options to highlight 1-5 attributes on the display.

We are going to use Python for the development of the t-SNE algorithm and the desktop app.
